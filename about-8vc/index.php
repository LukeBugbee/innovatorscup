North America’s best students must rise to the occasion and pursue inspirational projects that directly touch the lives of others. The goal of 8VC’s Social Innovator’s Cup is to fund, mentor, and accelerate the best entrepreneurial projects.</p>
			<p>The 8VC Social Innovator’s Cup will fund radical new initiatives that create “shared value” by expanding opportunity for all, raising standards of living, and strengthening civic bonds. Projects that harness market forces and community compassion can improve lives at scale.</p>
